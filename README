BenchPress
==========

BenchPress is a library used to run micro-benchmarks on Haskell code.
It produces detailed reports of the run benchmark that can be used to
better understand the behavior of the function under test.

Here's some example output:

$ ./my-benchmark
Times (ms)
   min      mean    +/-sd    median    max
 197.840  321.024  134.126  272.296  603.299

Percentiles (ms)
  50%  266.748
  66%  292.810
  75%  293.004
  80%  293.004
  90%  532.179
  95%  603.299
  98%  603.299
  99%  603.299
 100%  603.299

INSTALLING
----------

BenchPress uses the Cabal build infrastructure for building and
installing.  If you have cabal-install installed it is as simple as:

$ cabal install benchpress
